> A React UI project leveraging Material-UI / MUI components.  
> (You can replace this tag line with a more descriptive sentence that reflects what your app is.)

## About The Project

This project was created as a hands-on way for me to learn and practice MUI (Material-UI).  
To explore its components, styling system, and design patterns, I built a **credit card customizer** where users can adjust colors, card number, and visual elements.  
The goal is to understand how MUI behaves in real-world UI scenarios while improving my React and component design skills.


## Built With

List major frameworks / libraries / technologies used.  
For example:  
- React  
- MUI (Material-UI) — for UI components / styling  
- also Django for the backend,which will be added later
